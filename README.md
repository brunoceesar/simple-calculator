# Simple Calculator


Simple calculator for studies.

Great opportunity to challenge myself with some simple tasks for practice. I was able to learn new things I'll use in future projects.

## Fist attempt:

Tried to build this calculator by my on, had some problems and new ideas during the process:

- Operators showing up in display when clicked;
- Dit not have a previous input above the display;
- Need a decimal separator.

## Improvements after studies:

- Basic design changes;
- Previous number showing up;
- Decimal numbers working;
- Operators do not show up;
- Using data-bases instead of classes was an awesome thing to discover.
- Using class to write all main functions (another great thing to learn).
